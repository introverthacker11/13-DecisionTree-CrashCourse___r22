# Decision_Tree_Guidebook

Welcome to the **Decision_Tree_Guidebook** repository! This repository is a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing Decision Trees in machine learning using Python. From theoretical insights to practical implementation, this guide aims to provide everything you need to master Decision Trees.

## Topics Covered
This guidebook covers the following key aspects of Decision Trees:

### 1. **Decision Tree Introduction**
- Overview of Decision Trees and their importance in machine learning.
- Learn More: [Introduction to Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)

### 2. **How Decision Tree Works**
- A detailed explanation of how Decision Trees split data and make predictions.
- Learn More: [How Decision Trees Work](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-tree/)

### 3. **What is Attribute Selection Measures (ASM)?**
- Understanding criteria like Gini Index, Entropy, and Information Gain for splitting nodes.
- Learn More: [ASM Explained](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/classification-attribute-selection-classifiers-decision-tree-id3c45navie-bayes-linear-regression-knn/267513034)

### 4. **Dataset Loading**
- Loading datasets (e.g., `Social_Network_Ads.csv`, `car_data_kaggle.csv`) for training and evaluation.
- Learn More: [Data Loading with pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

### 5. **Dataset Visualization**
- Visualizing datasets to uncover patterns and insights for better model performance.
- Learn More: [Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

### 6 & 7. **Train-Test Split & Model Training and Evaluation**
- Splitting datasets into training and testing subsets and evaluating the Decision Tree model.
- Learn More: [Train-Test Split in scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html)

### 8 & 9. **Tree Visualization & Hyperparameter Optimization**
- Visualizing Decision Trees and tuning hyperparameters (e.g., `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`) for better performance.
- Learn More: [Tree Visualization with Graphviz](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree)

### 10 & 11. **Diabetes Dataset Loading & Decision Tree Regression**
- Loading and analyzing the Diabetes dataset and applying Decision Tree Regression.
- Learn More: [Decision Tree Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html)

### 12. **Parameters for Decision Tree**
- Exploring key parameters like `criterion`, `splitter`, `max_features`, and their impact on the model.
- Learn More: [Decision Tree Parameters](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)

## Datasets Included
- **Social_Network_Ads.csv**: Dataset for classification tasks.
- **car_data_kaggle.csv**: Dataset for regression and classification analysis.
